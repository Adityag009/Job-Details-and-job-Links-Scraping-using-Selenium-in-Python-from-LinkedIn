# Job-Details-and-job-Links-Scraping-using-Selenium-in-Python-from-LinkedIn.

### Summary: This code is used to scrape job postings from LinkedIn using Selenium, a Python package for web scraping. The code logs in to LinkedIn with a specified account, searches for job postings using certain keywords, and collects links to those postings. It then navigates to each posting and extracts relevant information, such as the company name, job title, and location, and saves this data to a CSV file.

### Sections:

1.Importing Required Libraries: In this section, we import the necessary libraries for web scraping, data processing, and file input/output.

2.Setting Up the Web Driver: In this section, we configure the Chrome web driver, set options to ignore SSL errors, and navigate to the LinkedIn login page.

3.Logging In to LinkedIn: In this section, we locate the email and password input fields on the login page and enter the login credentials. We then click the login button to submit the form.

4.Collecting Job Posting Links: In this section, we search for job postings using specific keywords, iterate through each page of results, and collect the URLs to each job posting.

5.Scraping Job Posting Data: In this section, we navigate to each job posting URL, extract relevant data such as company name, job title, and location, and save this data to a pandas dataframe.

6.Saving Data to CSV: In this section, we convert the pandas dataframe to a CSV file and save it to disk.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to use Selenium to automate web scraping tasks and extract data from a website like LinkedIn. However, it is important to note that web scraping is subject to website terms of use and should be done ethically and responsibly.
